# `enum-derive-2018`

This crate provides several macros for deriving some useful methods for unitary enums (*i.e.* enums where variants do not have payloads).

All of these macros are designed to be used with the [`macro-attr-2018`](https://crates.io/crates/macro-attr-2018) crate, though they can be used independent of it.
