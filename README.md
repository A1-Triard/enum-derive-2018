# `enum-derive-2018`

The [`enum-derive`](https://crates.io/crates/enum-derive) modern fork.

This crate provides several macros for deriving some useful methods for unitary enums
(*i.e.* enums where variants do not have payloads).

All of these macros are designed to be used with
the [`macro-attr-2018`](https://crates.io/crates/macro-attr-2018) crate,
though they can be used independent of it.
